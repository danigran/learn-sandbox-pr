In this module, you created a web app bot and connected it to a set of Q&A data. 

## More resources

There is much more that you can do to leverage the power of the Azure Bot Service by incorporating [Dialogs](http://aihelpwebsite.com/Blog/EntryId/9/Introduction-To-Using-Dialogs-With-The-Microsoft-Bot-Framework), [FormFlow](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2016/07/14/building-a-microsoft-bot-using-microsoft-bot-framework-using-formflow/), and [Microsoft Language Understanding and Intelligence Services (LUIS)](https://docs.botframework.com/node/builder/guides/understanding-natural-language/). By using these features in conjunction with others, you can build sophisticated bots that respond to users' queries and commands and interact in a fluid, conversational, and non-linear manner. For more information, and for ideas to get you started, see the [What is Microsoft Bot Framework Overview](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2016/04/05/what-is-microsoft-bot-framework-overview/). 

If you would like to make the bot smarter, consider expanding the knowledge base with additional questions and answers. For example, you could use the [online FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-resources-bot-framework-faq?view=azure-bot-service-3.0) for the Bot Framework to train the bot to answer questions about the framework itself.

## Clean up

The VM will automatically reset after a couple of hours. The timer should show in the VM window for how long it'll take before it resets.
